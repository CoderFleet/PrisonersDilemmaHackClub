I built a Python-based Prisoner's Dilemma simulation with a graphical user interface (GUI) to explore different strategies and see their real-time outcomes. This project allows you to test various strategies in the classic game theory scenario and visualize how each strategy performs over multiple rounds.

Features
Interactive GUI: Choose strategies for both players, set the number of rounds, and start or reset the simulation with buttons.
Real-Time Visualization: See how the game progresses with visual indicators including progress bars and a dynamic graph.
Detailed Logs & Statistics: View logs of each round, historical actions, and comprehensive statistics to understand the performance of different strategies.
